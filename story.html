              <p>"Smart people should build things." - Andrew Yang  </p>
              <hr>
              <p>I'd been working in the insurance industry for a little over a decade, but something had changed.  I was a successful Process Consultant/Project Manager with a great salary, tons of vacation time, and the ability to work from home.  So why wasn't I happy?  The things I enjoyed about my work became fewer and farther between.  I was good at my job, but the passion was fading.  Sound familiar?</p>
              <p>Walking away from a comfortable job that afforded me plenty of autonomy and opportunities to engage with senior leaders in my company seemed crazy.  But as 2017 drew to a close, it felt like the walls were closing in.  I couldn't seem to muster the energy to go the extra mile like I had in years past.  Basic tasks started to feel mundane and unworthy of the effort.  I knew that I couldn't spend another year drifting along.  I was too young, too determined to make a mark, but it was clear that I'd have to make a serious pivot to find my true calling.</p>
              <h2>Web Development</h2>
              <p>It started almost as an afterthought.  I'd been looking at side gigs that could bring in extra money and building websites on the side sounded like it could be fun.  As a practitioner of multiple martial arts, I thought I could specialize in updating and improving the typically awful sites that I saw for most of the schools in my area.  So I signed up for a two month CodeAcademy intensive course on "Building Web Sites from Scratch."</p>
              <p>I learned some HTML, some CSS, and put together a few project sites.  And something inside, just clicked.  Even though it wasn't "real" programming, I felt at home in arranging the elements and customizing them just so.  And it got me wondering "How deep does this rabbit hole go?"</p>
              <h3>When Conditions Are Right, Things Manifest</h3>
              <p>I had a meeting with my boss on the morning of January 2nd.  Our weekly chats were normally full of project discussion and reviewing plans, but this one took a turn rather quickly.  She asked "Do you still enjoy this job?" Maybe it was the fact that I hadn't slept well the night before, but something inside me screamed, "Just tell her!"</p>
              <p>So I did.  It all poured out: the frustration, the sadness, the guilt, and the NEED for something new.  And the most incredible part - she wanted to help.  So I had the runway I needed to make my exit plan.  But, what exactly was the plan???  In my next post, I'll talk about my research into the various options for my transition and how I landed on Skill Distillery in Denver as my best move.</p>

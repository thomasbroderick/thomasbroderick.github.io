              <hr>
              <p>Now that we've taken a look back at the past several months of my journey, it's time to start looking forward.  There are several things that I intend to accomplish by keeping up this blog.  First and foremost, it will serve as a travelogue through the ups and downs of learning to be a web developer.  I'll share my triumphs, my struggles, and all the lessons learned in between.  Just to give a quick example, I completed my first weekend assignment from Skill Distillery to build a Cash Register program.  It just covered the basics of variables, methods, loops, and if/else logic, but it definitely threw me for a few loops. For the (perhaps morbidly) curious, I'll be including a link to my Github account out on the home page. </p>
              <p>This leads to the second big focus of this blog, which is to work alongside my Github portfolio as a way for potential future employers to evaluate my experience and expertise using a variety of different languages, frameworks, and other tools.  Although I'm starting from a pretty basic level, it shouldn't be too long before my work starts to get more sophisticated.  The mid-term and final projects from SD should be rather advanced pieces of software, and I'm excited about the potential to show off all of our hard work. </p>
              <h2>Puzzles?</h2>
              <p>The last big component of this blog might come across as a head scratcher.  Did he just say puzzles?  Maybe it's the chess nerd in me coming out, but there's something really satisfying about solving a hard puzzle/problem.  In chess, that involves finding the best move or series of moves to win material or mate the opponent.  In this context, what I want to solve are programming challenges.</p>
              <p>Wouldn't you know, there is a gigantic repository of programming problems out on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/">Reddit</a>.  The challenges come in three different degrees of difficulty, so I'll be starting with the Easy ones and then moving up if/when I feel ready.  One nice thing about these challenges is we'll be able to compare my solution with the top voted solutions from the entire Reddit community to see what I might have missed.  I'll try REALLY hard not to cheat and I'll be posting my solution ahead of time and then going back to review the solutions.</p>
              <h3>Cadence</h3>
              <p>I'll be updating the blog every Tuesday and Friday, so keep checking back to see the latest content.  Each post will be tagged appropriately so that if you're a recruiter, you can get right to the portfolio posts.  If you're a solver, you can just check out my puzzle posts.  No matter why you're here, I'm glad to have you and I hope you stick around!</p>

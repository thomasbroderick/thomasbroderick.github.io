              <p>"Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought with ardor and diligence.‚Äù" - Abigail Adams</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Hey there everyone, it has been a little while since my last post and there's a lot to cover about my ongoing Java learning.  Skill Distillery advertises itself as "drinking from a firehose," and the last couple weeks have certainly lived up to that.  I've been spending 8-10 hours every day in the classroom for lectures, labs, and coding drills.  And then outside of that, I've been reading study materials after hours to fill in the gaps.  It's been a test of my mental agility, toughness, and desire.  But I'm happy to report that my passion for learning is still burning as brightly as ever. </p>
              <h2>Blackjack!</h2>
              <p>I want to share an experience that I had this past weekend while working on a project to build a Blackjack game in Java.  I spent a few hours on Friday sketching out the design and building the necessary classes/objects.  Then on Saturday, I had a working game for a single player, which was the minimum requirement.  I decided to go for one of the "stretch goals" that challenge us to push further.  What I discovered is that my code was not nearly modular enough to support multiple players and would need a whole lot of "refactoring" to get it there.  So I redrew my overall map, wrote a bunch of new methods, and bug tested the heck out of it until it was back to rock solid.</p>
              <p>It got me to reflect on the idea that we rarely make progress in life until we're challenged.  Until we're beaten down a little bit and we have to fight back.  One of the things I appreciate about programming is that there are no shortage of intellectual challenges to keep you sharp and push you out of your comfort zone.  In many ways, it reminds me of another one of my hobbies, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  The learning curve is steep, and going from white belt/beginner to black belt/expert is a long and difficult process, full of setbacks.  But when you push yourself to go one more round, to write one more JUnit test, and to create something in the world; it's a feeling unlike anything else.</p>
              <h3>Reddit: Not Just for Memes</h3>
              <p>I also completed my first Reddit coding challenge from the <a href = http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer>Daily Programmer</a> subreddit.  This one had me creating a tally sheet for scoring a game.  While the challenge was marked for Beginners, it allowed me to demonstrate some of the concepts I'd just recently learning in class such as iterating over Map objects and sorting Collections.  While my code was nowhere near as concise as some of the solutions I saw, it felt good to get that first one under my belt, and I look forward to doing more as the weeks progress.</p>
              <p>My big focus right now is studying for the OCP exam that tests your knowledge of Java syntax.  My confidence is growing with each passing day and some concepts that felt intimidating just last week (hey there Polymorphism!) are starting to seem more natural.  The final test is set for the day after Memorial Day, so there's only about a week left of our Java intensive before we move on to JPA and Spring!  As always, thanks for reading and I'll be back next week to check in!

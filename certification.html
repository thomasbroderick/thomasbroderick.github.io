              <p>"When I'm hiring, I don't look for credentials, I look for knowledge." - Aza Raskin  </p>
              <hr>
              <p>This post will end up being a bit of a contradiction.  On the one hand, I want to talk about the pride I'm feeling after passing the Oracle Java Programmer I certification exam.  On the other hand, I want to note my skepticism about credentials like this and emphasize the quest for knowledge for its own sake.  So the first thing to get out of the way is that I took and passed that Oracle exam last Friday and achieved one of the highest scores in my class.  I'm officially a certified Java programmer!  It's a big deal, and I want to celebrate the efforts and time that went into making this happen.  Skill Distillery did a fantastic job of preparing me and my classmates for the material on the exam.</p>
              <p>But I also know that it's just a first step in a very, very long journey.  There's always going to be some aspect of programming that is just a little outside my reach and my understanding.  Another topic to research and master in my path to becoming a Developer.  Which is why I was back on Reddit the very next day picking out another programming challenge to work on this weekend.  Even as we move on from Java to other topics such as SQL and JavaScript, I want to keep my chops sharp by solving these kinds of puzzles.  Here's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/879u8b/20180326_challenge_355_easy_alphabet_cipher/">the one</a> I chose, in case you're curious.</p>
              <h2>Hello, old friends</h2>
              <p>This week, we're covering HTML and CSS, which I learned just recently from the two month CodeAcademy intensive course on "Building Web Sites from Scratch."  Between that course and Bootstrap, I feel pretty comfortable already in my web page creation skills.  I'm anxious to see how SD ends up building on that knowledge as we move toward combining it with database work in SQL.</p>
              <p>One big change that you're likely to see is some updates to the formatting and style of this blog.  I'd like to add some more of the interactive elements such as the search bars and the archives.  So look for those functions to be coming online in the near future. I've also put some thought into how to make sure that the most important content stays visible, even though those posts are some of the oldest content on the blog.  So look for those elements to receive a featured spot moving forward so that new visitors can see where I started out and why this blog exists in the first place. </p>
              <h3>Questions, Comments, Concerns?</h3>
              <p>I've also thought about turning on some form of comment functionality to allow my readers to suggest what they'd like to see or questions that they have about coding boot camps, career switching, or other programming topics.  I know there might not be too many readers of this blog just yet, but if this blog continues to expand, I'd like to find a good way to implement it.  To those few faithful readers out there, thanks for your support and suggestions.</p>

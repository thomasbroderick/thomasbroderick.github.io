              <p>"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today." - Ancient Chinese Proverb </p>
              <hr>
              <p>In my last post, I shared a little bit of the background story behind my decision to leave a comfortable, work-from-home career as a Project Manager to carve a new path as a Web Developer.  Although it's only been a week since I made that transition, I'm already starting to see some transformations in my overall satisfaction and outlook on life.  I feel rejuvenated and I don't want to waste a moment of this new opportunity.  </p>
              <p>But let's back up a couple months and talk about how I got to this point.  I'd had the difficult conversation with my boss about wanting to find something new.  I knew that programming was something that could become a legit second career, but I also knew from prior experience how hard it was to master a programming language.  I'd tried on a few different occasions to learn Python, since it was billed as a solid beginner language.  But trying to learn the fundamentals of programming without any guidance from a teacher or mentor was simply too daunting.  I just couldn't push through the frustration, and so I knew that if I was going to make a serious run at this, I was going to need professional help.</p>
              <h2>Ten-Hut</h2>
              <p>I'd heard of coding bootcamps before, but never really done any serious research on how they worked.  My brother-in-law went to one a few years back that focused on teaching Ruby on Rails and he found a development job shortly thereafter.  Mostly I was put off by the expense and the time commitment, since it wasn't something that I could do in my spare time while working my regular 9 to 5.</p>
              <p>Once I'd made the decision to pursue a new career, however, the thought of making a radical break and diving in head first started to make more sense.  I've always been the kind of person who likes to make changes in a dramatic fashion, rather than piecemeal.  I spent nearly 6 months as a vegan after reading a book about animal rights and the health benefits of a plant-based diet.  But with a family to think about, I couldn't afford (in any sense of the word) to make this decision lightly.  I needed to do my homework and find the best fit.</p>
              <h3>Distilling it Down</h3>
              <p>After an hour or two of Google Fu, I'd narrowed my search down to just a couple of viable options.  I wanted to stay reasonably close to my home here in Colorado, so the Denver area was where I focused my search.  Eventually it came down to a choice between Skill Distillery and Galvanize, which both had stellar reputations online, and costs that were within my budget.</p>
              <p>What really sold me on Skill Distillery as my final choice was their curriculum.  Teaching Java as the primary language for a boot camp is definitely an uncommon choice.  Most schools either teach Ruby on Rails or Javascript at their language of choice due to the ease of learning their syntax and how quickly you can get a beginner up and running.  Java has the opposite reputation.  Obtuse, difficult, and certainly not good for beginners.  So why did I choose to go this route?  BECAUSE IT WAS HARDER!</p>
              <p>I wanted that challenge.  I want to learn and master a skill that others shy away from. And you know what?  That difficulty is reflected in the demand for Java programmers.  Just check out this <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Java-skills-demand-hits-all-time-high">article</a> from Computer Weekly showing that demand for Java skills is soaring.  Now that's a market I want to be competing in!  So that's why, as of today, I'm finishing up Week 1 of a demanding 16 week program with Skill Distillery.  Next week, I'll share about my learning journey and talk about how I'll be using this blog to showcase my new skills and to broaden my network.  I hope you'll come along for this crazy new ride! </p>

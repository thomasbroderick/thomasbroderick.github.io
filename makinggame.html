              <p>Over the last few days, I've gotten the opportunity to cross off one of my bucket list items that I didn't even realize was on there.  We're making an honest to goodness Role-Playing Game as part of my boot camp!  As someone who has played more than his fair share of Dungeons and Dragons over the years, the prospect of creating heroes, enemies, and a "Choose Your Own Adventure" style game is hitting me right in the feels.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>No, it's nothing fancy, just a tiny little text crawler with just a few different battles and a bare-bones interface.  But the fact that we can even think about doing something like this after only 10 days in the program is pretty incredible.  I'm working on a team with two other people and we've already starting spinning out so many stretch goals for where we could take this if we had more than just a few hours to build it.  But this gets right to the heart of why I chose Software Development for my new career.  I really want to <em>MAKE THINGS</em>.</p>

              <h2>Lord of the Objects</h2>
              <p>We've covered so much ground in the last two weeks that it's hard to keep up with all of the concepts that we're being exposed to each day.  Object Oriented Programming is the big focus, so we've talked about Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and tons of other Java specifics.  I don't feel like I'm drowning just yet, but the water is getting deeper and I've just gotta swim as fast as I can. One thing that's been helpful for me is being able to bounce questions off of my fellow students and the instructors.  As someone who's tried on multiple occasions to self-teach coding - that's a major leg up.  Tomorrow we're going to watch presentations from the cohort that started back in February, so I'll get a chance to see the kinds of things I'll be able to build in just eight more weeks.  Happy Friday to me!</p>
              <h3>Blog Updates!</h3>
              <p>As you can see, I've expanded the blog with some additional Bootstrap goodness.  Once I've got a few more weekly projects up on my Github, I'll be sharing those links with you all.  I'll also get a LinkedIn page connected, once I'm ready for future employers to see who's behind all of this.  I'm slowly getting the tags figured out so that my Search functionality will be a Go in the next week or two.</p>
